Welcome to this small Python site to evaluate the Upstart Macro Index (UMI)
and some of the macro variables it correlates to.

This repository contains the following files:
* data_processing.ipynb - Code to import UMI and macro data into CSVs
* umi_correlation.ipynb - Code to evaluate the UMI and macro correlations using CSVs
* LICENSE - MIT License we released this repository under
* data/umi.csv - Data file as downloaded from Upstart's website
* data/umi_data.csv - Data file with UMI data slightly updated for easier handling
* data/macro_data.csv - Data with downloaded Macro data


You will need to add a file named '.env' and set the variable 
FRED_API_KEY to your FRED API key. If you don't have one, you can get one here:
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html . To learn more about loading
environment variables into python, please see https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/.
